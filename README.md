# Python leet codes and other practice problems


## Run the tests
```bash
python -m pytest
```
## Debugger

The `launch.json` file includes the necessary config to support using the vscode python debugger with pytest.


# Docker Container

This project includes a Dockerfile that can be used to build a container that can be used to run the tests.
Though this is all handled by the .devcontainer configuration if you are using vscode.
